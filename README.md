# Hxighlighter
Hxighlighter is a new standalone version of the JS code contained in the [HxAT project](https://github.com/lduarte1991/hxat).

## Biggest Changes
1. Removed all code related to the v1.2.10 of the Annotator project
1. Added in as little of the v2.0 Annotator project as is necessary to develop the newest iteration
1. Created a more modular library to be used within the HxAT and allow for easier customization when dealing with UI and Storage
1. Allow for local web browser storage and allow pushing to remote storage when it becomes available.
1. Allow multiple instances of the tool to exist at one time.

## Usage
Not intended to have full functionality without also using the HxAT. It should be possible (and even encouraged) to use this as a "lite" mode of the functionality above.
