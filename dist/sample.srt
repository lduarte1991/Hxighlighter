1
00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:09.120
Now, we have a painting we want to show.

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.970
It's thought to be from the 11th century,

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.490
and it's showing you some rather interesting stuff.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.680
And it has some bearing, I think, on what's

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.070
going on in the economy and society and the new policies.

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.160
But let's take a look at it and I'll point some things out for you

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.140
and you can, perhaps, do some more with it on your own.

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.280
Let's begin on the right side of the painting.

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.650
You see the building in the lower right, and that wooden structure,

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.440
pointless wooden structure that appears right before the front door.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.800
Well, those structures were typical in cities in the 11th century.

12
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.930
They disappear later, but in the 11th century they're still typical.

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.050
They're put in front of wine houses, restaurants, and hotels.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.700
And if you look to the right there and look around, what you're seeing,

15
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.970
I think, is a hotel, an inn.

16
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.660
And right out of the front door you see an innkeeper peeking.

17
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.210
He's peeking out of the front door.

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.910
Well, why is there an inn there and what are they doing?

19
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.120
Let's go to the center of this picture for a moment.

20
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.160
There is-- you see a house, two floors, a fancy house, open.

21
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.120
And in the middle of it, what do you see?

22
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.440
Down at the bottom that's a water wheel.

23
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.880
It's a horizontal water wheel and you can see the water gushing in,

24
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.510
and it turns that wheel and above, on the second floor,

25
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.470
you see the stones grinding wheat-- I assume it's wheat-- into flour.

26
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.480
Now, if you look at the rest of painting,

27
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.200
you'll see that in one way or another everything revolves around that.

28
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.030
So people are going to the inn because they're bringing grain to the mill.

29
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.240
Perhaps, selling it, perhaps, paying the mill to work on it.

30
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.280
You see different kinds of boats.

31
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.430
You see people doing different parts of the job of getting grain milled.

32
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.530
And then over in the left, up in a pavilion in the upper left,

33
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.490
you see a group of people sitting around a table.

34
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.110
And as far as we know, those are officials.

35
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.110
So this mill is not a private mill.

36
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.190
It's a government mill.

37
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.456
Given the looks of things, it's a mill in the city or on the edge of the city.

38
00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.990
The officials are there running it.

39
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.690
And so at the very least, this is a picture

40
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.680
that shows the role of government in the economy.
