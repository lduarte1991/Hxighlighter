                    <p>
                    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
                    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
                    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
                    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
                    "'T is some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door--<br>
                                                              Only this, and nothing more."</p>

                    <p>
                    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
                    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
                    Eagerly I wished the morrow:--vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
                    From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--<br>
                    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--<br>
                                                              Nameless here for evermore.</p>

                    <p>
                    And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
                    Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
                    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
                    "'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door<br>
                    Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--<br>
                                                              This it is, and nothing more."</p>

                    <p>
                    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
                    "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
                    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
                    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
                    That I scarce was sure I heard you"--here I opened wide the door;--<br>
                                                              Darkness there, and nothing more.</p>

                    <p>
                    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
                    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
                    But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br>
                    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br>
                    This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"<br>
                                                              Merely this and nothing more.</p>

                    <p>
                    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
                    Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before.<br>
                    "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>
                    Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--<br>
                    Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--<br>
                                                              'T is the wind and nothing more!"</p>

                    <p>
                    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
                    In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.<br>
                    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
                    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--<br>
                    Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--<br>
                                                              Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>

                    <p>
                    Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
                    By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
                    "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>
                    Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,--<br>
                    Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>
                                                              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
                    Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;<br>
                    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
                    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--<br>
                    Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
                                                              With such name as "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
                    That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
                    Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--<br>
                    Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have flown before--<br>
                    On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br>
                                                              Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
                    "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>
                    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
                    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--<br>
                    Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
                                                              Of 'Never--nevermore.'"</p>

                    <p>
                    But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,<br>
                    Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;<br>
                    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
                    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--<br>
                    What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>
                                                              Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
                    To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
                    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
                    On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>
                    But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er<br>
                                                              _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
                    <img src="./testimage.png" alt="Cropped screenshot from Mac OSX High Sierra">
                    <p>
                    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
                    Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
                    "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
                    Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
                    Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"<br>
                                                              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--<br>
                    Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
                    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--<br>
                    On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--<br>
                    Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"<br>
                                                              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
                    By that Heaven that bends above, us--by that God we both adore--<br>
                    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
                    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--<br>
                    Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br>
                                                              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I shrieked, upstarting--<br>
                    "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
                    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
                    Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!<br>
                    Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br>
                                                              Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>

                    <p>
                    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
                    On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
                    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
                    And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
                    And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
                                                              Shall be lifted--nevermore!</p>
